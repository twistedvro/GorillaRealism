<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> 9/5/2025</p>

<h2>Gorilla Realism Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Gorilla Realism is developed by vrocacho.</p>

<h2>What data do we collect? How do we store your data?</h2>
<p>Your login username and in-game settings are collected and stored by the Gorilla Realism game application directly on your headset. Passwords are never stored anywhere; instead a challenge is generated from your password that is then stored on our servers and used to authenticate your account. That digest is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>The game application does not collect any analytics.</p>
<p>Any and all data on the headset can be deleted by deleting the application from the headset.</p>
<p>Any and all data on our servers is deleted automatically after 6 months of your last login.</p>
<p>If you wish to have your server data deleted before the default 6 months, contact us at <strong>vro@gorillarealism.com</strong> and we will confirm your account, remove the data, and return an email confirming the removal.</p>

<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>We will not reach out to you for marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>Security of your personal data</h2>
<p>The security of your personal data is important to us, but no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Gorilla Realism does not leak any of your personal data.</p>
